---------------------
Lem-in is an algorithm project, where ants have to go the fastest as posible from start-room to end-room.

>"Ants" need to go from room to room (if they are linked) to the "End room". <br>
>You start in a start room and have a combination of rooms connected to each other <br>
>and end up in a final room. The program take the combinations and calculates wich set <br>
>of rooms will be the shortest or only route.

<br><br>

*To Run*
>Enter "make re" <br>
>Enter "./lem-in < maps/name_of_map.map" <br>
>maps contains all the maps <br>
